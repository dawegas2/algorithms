Problem Description
Task. Given an directed graph with possibly negative edge weights and with 𝑛 vertices and 𝑚 edges, check
whether it contains a cycle of negative weight.
Input Format. A graph is given in the standard format.
Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 10^3, 0 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 10^4, edge weights are integers of absolute value at most 10^3.
Output Format. Output 1 if the graph contains a cycle of negative weight and 0 otherwise.
