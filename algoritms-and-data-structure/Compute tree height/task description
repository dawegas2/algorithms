Task. You are given a description of a rooted tree. Your task is to compute and output its height. Recall
that the height of a (rooted) tree is the maximum depth of a node, or the maximum distance from a
leaf to the root. You are given an arbitrary tree, not necessarily a binary tree.
Input Format. The first line contains the number of nodes 𝑛. The second line contains 𝑛 integer numbers
from −1 to 𝑛 − 1 — parents of nodes. If the 𝑖-th one of them (0 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛 − 1) is −1, node 𝑖 is the root,
otherwise it’s 0-based index of the parent of 𝑖-th node. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one root.
It is guaranteed that the input represents a tree.
Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 105.

Output Format. Output the height of the tree.
