Problem Introduction
In this problem, your goal is to simulate a sequence of merge operations with tables in a database.
Problem Description
Task. There are 𝑛 tables stored in some database. The tables are numbered from 1 to 𝑛. All tables share
the same set of columns. Each table contains either several rows with real data or a symbolic link to
another table. Initially, all tables contain data, and 𝑖-th table has 𝑟𝑖 rows. You need to perform 𝑚 of
the following operations:
1. Consider table number 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖. Traverse the path of symbolic links to get to the data. That is,
while 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 contains a symbolic link instead of real data do
𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 ← symlink(𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖)
2. Consider the table number 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖 and traverse the path of symbolic links from it in the same
manner as for 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖.
3. Now, 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 and 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖 are the numbers of two tables with real data. If 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 !=
𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖, copy all the rows from table 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖 to table 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖, then clear the table 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖
and instead of real data put a symbolic link to 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖
into it.
4. Print the maximum size among all 𝑛 tables (recall that size is the number of rows in the table).
If the table contains only a symbolic link, its size is considered to be 0.
See examples and explanations for further clarifications.
Input Format. The first line of the input contains two integers 𝑛 and 𝑚 — the number of tables in the
database and the number of merge queries to perform, respectively.
The second line of the input contains 𝑛 integers 𝑟𝑖 — the number of rows in the 𝑖-th table.
Then follow 𝑚 lines describing merge queries. Each of them contains two integers 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖 and
𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖 — the numbers of the tables to merge.
Constraints. 1 ≤ 𝑛, 𝑚 ≤ 100 000; 0 ≤ 𝑟𝑖 ≤ 10 000; 1 ≤ 𝑑𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖, 𝑠𝑜𝑢𝑟𝑐𝑒𝑖 ≤ 𝑛.
Output Format. For each query print a line containing a single integer — the maximum of the sizes of all
tables (in terms of the number of rows) after the corresponding operation.

Sample 1.
Input:
5 5
1 1 1 1 1
3 5
2 4
1 4
5 4
5 3
Output:
2
2
3
5
5
In this sample, all the tables initially have exactly 1 row of data. Consider the merging operations:
1. All the data from the table 5 is copied to table number 3. Table 5 now contains only a symbolic
link to table 3, while table 3 has 2 rows. 2 becomes the new maximum size.
2. 2 and 4 are merged in the same way as 3 and 5.
3. We are trying to merge 1 and 4, but 4 has a symbolic link pointing to 2, so we actually copy
all the data from the table number 2 to the table number 1, clear the table number 2 and put a
symbolic link to the table number 1 in it. Table 1 now has 3 rows of data, and 3 becomes the new
maximum size.
4. Traversing the path of symbolic links from 4 we have 4 → 2 → 1, and the path from 5 is 5 → 3.
So we are actually merging tables 3 and 1. We copy all the rows from the table number 1 into the
table number 3, and now the table number 3 has 5 rows of data, which is the new maximum.
5. All tables now directly or indirectly point to table 3, so all other merges won’t change anything.
