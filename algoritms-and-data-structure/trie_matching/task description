Multiple Pattern Matching Problem
Find all occurrences of a collection of patterns in a text.
Input: A string Text and a collection Patterns containing (shorter) strings.
Output: All starting positions in Text where a string from Patterns appears as a substring.

Problem Description
Input Format. The first line of the input contains a string Text, the second line contains an integer 𝑛,
each of the following 𝑛 lines contains a pattern from Patterns = {𝑝1, . . . , 𝑝𝑛}.
Constraints. 1 ≤ |Text| ≤ 10 000; 1 ≤ 𝑛 ≤ 5 000; 1 ≤ |𝑝𝑖| ≤ 100 for all 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑛; all strings contain only
symbols A, C, G, T; no 𝑝𝑖 is a prefix of 𝑝𝑗 for all 1 ≤ 𝑖 != 𝑗 ≤ 𝑛.
Output Format. All starting positions in Text where a string from Patterns appears as a substring in
increasing order (assuming that Text is a 0-based array of symbols).

Sample 1.
Input:
AAA
1
AA
Output:
0 1
The pattern AA appears at positions 0 and 1. Note that these two occurrences of the pattern overlap.
